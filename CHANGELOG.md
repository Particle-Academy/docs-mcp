## [Unreleased]

## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-07

### Changed

- **BREAKING — Node 22 is no longer supported.** `engines.node` moves from `>=22` to `>=22`.

  **What you must do:** on Node 22 or newer, nothing. Note npm only *warns* on an `engines` mismatch while **pnpm fails the install**, so this surfaces differently depending on your package manager. Node 18 is end-of-life and 20 is maintenance-only.

### Why

These are the kit 0.5 platform floors, applied across every package at once so a consumer never has to resolve a mix. **No API changed, nothing was removed, nothing was renamed** — only what the package requires.


## 0.1.1 — 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- drop ./ prefix from bin paths so npm doesn't strip them on publish

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-12

### Added

- initial @particle-academy/docs-mcp@0.1.0
